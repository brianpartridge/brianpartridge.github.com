                                    The app launched, but no apps are shown.

                                        First thing to try is to make sure you have a WiFi or cellular data connection, then pull down on the area below the search bar. An arrow and message will appear telling you to pull down and release to rescan for apps. Installed apps should appear in a list in a moment.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If that doesn't work, it's possible that Pocket Share couldn't detect any of your apps. For now, you can search for apps with the built in App Store search bar and share apps from the results.
                                    </p>
                                </dd>
                                <dt>
                                    I have app X installed, but it isn't shown in the list.
                                </dt>
                                <dd>
                                    <p>
                                        Pocket Share can detect many of the third party apps that you have installed on your iPhone from the App Store, but not all of them. There are several techniques used to detect apps and I'm working hard to make them even better.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For now, you can still search for the missing app with the built in App Store search bar and share the app from the results.
                                    </p>
                                </dd>
                                <dt>
                                    I have app X installed, but you show "X Free" or "X HD" instead.
                                </dt>
                                <dd>
                                    <p>
                                        It isn't always cut and dry which version of app is installed so a bit of educated guessing is performed. I think the technique is pretty good, but I'm working to make it even better.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For now, you can swipe an app and tap the "Hide" button to remove it from the list. You can search for the missing app with the built in App Store search bar.
                                    </p>

                                    I'm a developer and my app isn't detected, what can I do to make it appear?

                                        I'm working on a system to automate this. In the meantime, you can search for the missing app with the built in App Store search bar and share the app from the results.

                                    What is LinkShare?
                                </dt>

                                        LinkShare provides affiliate marketing services for the iOS App Store, which enables publishers such as yourself to earn commissions on products that you market.  Basically, that means that anytime you share a link to an app in the App Store, you can earn a commission on any sales made by following that link.
